''''To create a program that formats folders and files
according to the structure shown in your screenshot, 
I will draft a system to organize the files based on your specifications. 
Here's how the structure will be handled, considering the timestamp and labels:


### **Folder Structure**
1. **Root Output_Folder:** `work-logs/2024`
2. *
*Subfolders:**
   - **Daily:** Includes daily logs in the format `ddd-DD-MM-YY/` (e.g., `Mon-02-12-24/`).
   - **Monthly:** Contains a folder for each month in the format `YY-MM/` (e.g., `24-12/`).
   - **Weekly:** Weekly logs are organized in the format `[w]ww-MM-dd/` (e.g., `[w]49-12-02/`).



### **Program Workflow**
1. Parse the timestamp of each file.
2. Create folders dynamically based on the structure.
3. Save files into their respective folders.
